# Specification Quality Checklist: Contracts and Server Hub

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- SC-001 mentions "single command" which is borderline implementation detail but acceptable as a user-experience metric.
- Assumptions section documents that C# is used for AppHost and F# for services — these are architectural constraints from the design documents, not implementation leaks in the spec body itself.
- All 14 checklist items pass. Spec is ready for planning.
